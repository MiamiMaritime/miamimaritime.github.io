The Government Cut jetty extension contract, let to Comer and Webster, requires granite. James Webster, a retired wrecker, has located and salvaged 1000 tons of high grade Vermont granite from wrecked steamers along the coast. He is salvaging more from depths of 40 feet and all of it will be used on the jetties.
