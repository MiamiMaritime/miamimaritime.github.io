Jackson Jenks and members of Protection of Historical Sites (Underwater) Inc. raise two cannons from the frigate HMS Fly sunk in 3 fathoms of water off the Keys. Art McKee, who has the legal salvage rights from Point Charles to Lower Matecumbe, arrives at the site and makes them put the cannons back with the help of a Monroe County sheriff. McKee claims they are on a 1733 Spanish wrecksite. [Photo]
