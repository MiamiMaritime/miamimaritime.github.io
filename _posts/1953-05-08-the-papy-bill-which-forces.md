The Papy Bill, which forces the state to sell a strip of property from Key Biscayne across Elliott Key to Key Largo to private developers, is before the State Legislature. The bill, introduced by Bernie Papy and authored by Thomas Horobin and Joseph Kelleher, is aimed at reversing a previous policy to freeze the sale of all state owned waterfront and islands.
