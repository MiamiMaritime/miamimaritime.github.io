The Spanish tramp steamer Valmaseda with a cargo of coal and peat is aground on the reef about 4 miles south of Fowey Light. Revenue cutter Forward is on her way from Key West to Leadbury Reef. A Board of Survey [interesting list of members] finds she is in 22 feet of water and the hold is flooded.
