The lowest barometric pressure is recorded in Miami (28.78-28.15 inches) as a fierce storm hits lower east coast. Many damaged vessels: St. Lucie is reported lost, Klondike is carried into the woods, Samoa is driven on a bank in the river, barges are scattered around the bay and boats are piled up along the sides of the river.
