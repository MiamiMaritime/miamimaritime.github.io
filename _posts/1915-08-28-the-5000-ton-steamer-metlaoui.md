The 5000 ton steamer Metlaoui went aground near the Alicia on Ajax Reef on 23 August. The captain saw portions of the old Alicia wreck and tried to go around it on the land side. Loaded with copper ore, wreckers Curry and Albury pulled the ship free last night. Another steamer is aground at Molasses Reef. U.S. Commissioner Ewan states that Miami is in need of wrecking signals. He suggests a red flag hoisted at Royal Palm Docks and the lighthouse to alert wreckers of a "rackonereef".
