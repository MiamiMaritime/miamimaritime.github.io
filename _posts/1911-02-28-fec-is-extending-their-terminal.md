FEC is extending their terminal dock on to city property causing more tension between the city and FEC. [This has been developing. For the last year or so there has been a dispute over ownership of Tuttle's bayfront property. Sides are now being taken. Keep in mind that the Miami Morning News-Record has been bought by Flagler and is now The Miami Herald.]
