Carl Fisher's concrete hull freighter Saponia will not be suitable as a moored fishing club 1.5 miles off Cocolobo Cay as planned. So a channel is dug at Miami Beach and the Saponia is run in toward shore under her own power. She is now settled into the sand and is used as a storage house while her machinery is removed.
